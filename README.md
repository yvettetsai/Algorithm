CS330-Algorithm
===============

This repository contains some popular algorithm's implementation in Java.


Project 1 - MST
===============
Goal: 
  To determine how the average weight of the minimum spanning tree 
  grows as a function of n for each of these families of graphs. Where 
  weights are asign with two option. Option one, weight of each edge is 
  a real number chosen uniformaly at random from [0,1]. Option two, weight
  of each edge is the Euclidean distance between its endpoints where the
  endpoints are chosen uniformly at radnom inside the unit square.

Project 2 - Number Partition
============================
Goal: 
  Number Partition is a NP-Complete problem, but we can be solved in 
  pseudopolynomial time. Our goal is to try two different approaches
  to solve the problem. First approach is to use dynamic programming.
  Second approach is to use Karmarkar-Karp algorithm, a deterministic 
  heuristic.
